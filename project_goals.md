PuppetBricks Project
====================

Problem Statement
-----------------

Puppet provides an excellent framework of low-level components for systems
management. The forge provides a central repository for all published Puppet
modules. Puppet Labs Supported modules are high quality, but are few in number.
Puppet Labs Approved modules are considered to be well-written and maintained,
but there can be multiple modules for a single task.

The gap is that there is no project that does for Puppet modules what Linux
distributions does for all of the software which comprises it: Provide a
curated set of Puppet modules from a variety of sources to provide a
ready-to-use environment for common system administration tasks.

PuppetBricks intends to fill that gap.

Project Goals
-------------

1. Establish a set of standards and comprehensive documentation by which a
module will be considered for inclusion.

2. Provide a curated list of modules, sources, and versions with project
recommendations in a format easily consumable for the community (r10k?)

3. Write and contribute new modules (or patches to existing modules) as
necessary to fill in gaps.

4. Collect/write profile classes (R&P style) which could be used as simple
building blocks or as examples of module use. (maybe)
